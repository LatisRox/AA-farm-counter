countdown with locations for farms in archeage

Download and extarct everything in the same place and open farmcounter.html.

When you find a farm in AA, take a screenshot of the map location, cut the map location so its in the clipboard and paste it just like it says on the farmcounter page. The page will show the thumbnail of the picture if it was done correctly. 
Then input the time until the farm is ready to be harvested and start the counter. Leave the page open and it will alert you 30m and 10m before the farm is ready to be harvested and also when the farm its ready to be harvested.

happy farming
